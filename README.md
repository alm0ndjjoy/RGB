# RGB Generator

Ever get bored of using the same RGB value? 

Ever get stuck choosing a color for your webpage?

I created an app that generates a random RGB value using my knowledge of DOM manipulation.


Now you can use this web application for your next project! Just click the button until you find your color of choice and then copy & paste the value into your own project!
